# WinSafe examples

This folder contains several examples of applications written in Rust with WinSafe. All examples follow the same program structure, which is the recommended way to build an application.

Each subfolder is a full application, with is own `Cargo.toml`. The examples use [embed-resource](https://crates.io/crates/embed-resource) crate to compile and embed the `.rc` file into the final `.exe`.

The subfolders are numbered starting from the easiest example. Note that this order can change at any time, as new examples can be added.
