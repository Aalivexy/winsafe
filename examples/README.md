# WinSafe examples

This folder contains several examples of applications written in Rust with WinSafe. Each subfolder is a full application, with is own `Cargo.toml`.

The examples use [embed-resource](https://crates.io/crates/embed-resource) crate to compile and embed the `.rc` file into the final `.exe`.

The subfolders are numbered starting from the easiest example. Note that this order can change at any time, as new examples can be added.
